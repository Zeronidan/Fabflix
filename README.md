# Fabflix
Collaborated with 2 classmates, Alicia Xu and Evelyn Li to create a e-commerce movie database 
website Fabflix (parody of Netflix).

Technologies used:
- Java
- MySQL (JDBC)
- JSP
- Java Servlet
- HTML
- XML
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Apache Tomcat
- Recaptcha

In the website the user can do a secure login using an email, password, and recaptcha 
for authentication.  From there the user can either search or browse for movies on the home page.

With the search page, the user can search for movies by one or more conditions: given the
movie's title, year, director, and actors/actresses.  With the browsing page, the user can 
browse via movie genre or movie title.  

Once the requests are made, the website sends requests to retrieve information from the MySQL 
database and the website generates a movie list that displays the movies and their information 
(title, year, director, genres, actors/actresses, and rating).

The Fabflix website also supports a shopping cart and checkout feature.  The user can add and 
remove movies from their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
