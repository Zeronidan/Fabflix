	<p>1. For actors63.xml, we used batch insert, which reduced its
		time from over 6 minutes to around 4 minutes.</p>
	<p>2. For all three xml files, we used HashMap and HashSets to
		reduce duplicate searching time. It reduces time because querying the
		database for a duplicate is slower than checking a HashMap or HashSet.
	</p>
	<p>2a. The time for the main243.xml was reduced from over 10
		minutes to around 2.5 minutes using a HashMap to check for duplicates.
	</p>
	<p>3. For casts124, we created different HashMaps to reduce the
		need to query the database multiple times for movies, stars, and
		stars_in_movies.</p>
